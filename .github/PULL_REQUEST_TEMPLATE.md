Hanami Model is currently being re-worked to be based on ROM (Ruby Object Mapper), as of May 31 2016.
Please see work on this branch: https://github.com/hanami/model/tree/new-engine

Generally speaking, any new features will be rejected until that branch is merged into master,
since it's significantly altering the code-base.

Thanks for understanding :)
